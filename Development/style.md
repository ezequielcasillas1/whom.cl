WEBSITE STYLE GUIDE — GENERATION PROMPT

Design a modern, high-end fashion e-commerce website with a maximalist, editorial, and futuristic aesthetic.

Overall Mood & Tone

Dark, bold, and intentional

Quiet confidence, premium, serious

Editorial fashion magazine meets techwear

No playfulness, no clutter, no excess decoration

Color Palette

Primary: Deep black (#000000 to #0E0E0E)

Secondary: Soft concrete gray, cool stone textures

Text: Pure white and muted off-white

Accents: Maximal monochrome presence

No bright colors, no gradients

Typography

Sans-serif, modern, geometric

Uppercase for headings

Tight letter spacing (tracking slightly reduced)

Clean hierarchy:

Large bold headlines

Smaller, spaced navigation text

Maximal labels like /001, /002

Typography should feel architectural, not playful

Layout & Structure

Full-width black content sections

Strong use of negative space

Content framed like a gallery or editorial spread

Asymmetrical but balanced layout

Clear separation between text and product imagery

Product sections numbered subtly (e.g. /001, /002)

Imagery Style

High-contrast fashion photography

Dark clothing, techwear, tactical silhouettes

Models partially obscured (hoods, masks, shadows)

Industrial or brutalist environments

Editorial framing, not lifestyle smiling poses

Images feel cold, controlled, and deliberate

UI Elements

Maximal navigation presence

Text-first design, images support—not dominate

No rounded buttons; sharp edges preferred

Subtle hover states only

No icons unless essential

Pricing and product names understated

Copy Style

Confident, abstract, forward-looking language

No hype words

Sentences feel manifesto-like

Example tone:

“Unveil the essentials of tomorrow.”

“Designed for function. Built for intent.”

Branding Feel

Luxury streetwear / techwear

Editorial fashion house

Modern, intelligent, restrained

Feels expensive without being loud

What to Avoid

Bright colors

Excess animations

Drop shadows

Over-rounded UI

Casual or friendly language

Crowded product grids

SHORT VERSION (if tool needs brevity)

Maximal black fashion e-commerce website, editorial techwear aesthetic, brutalist architecture inspiration, uppercase sans-serif typography, high contrast imagery, gallery-style layout, bold numbering system, dark luxury mood, text-driven design, premium presence.
